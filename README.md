## Changes

2022/09/06 Experimentally moved to nbdev 2021/07/21 Upgraded
installation mechanism. 2020/11/09 Changed repository name from `pyXTel`
to `pyXSurf`.

## Installation

Download or clone the project. You can use git clone command by:

``` sh
git clone https://github.com/vincenzooo/pyXSurf.git
```

or the `download` button at top of page.

At this point you have two options:

1.  Python installer (suggested): move to the folder with the code and
    call

``` sh
python setup.py install
```

.

2.  Developer:

``` sh
pip install -e '.[dev]'
```

Developers branches can be installed in the same way and they should
work equally (just have more unfinished stuff), so the only thing you
need to do differently, is to switch branch,
e.g. `git checkout documentation` (where `documentation` is the name of
the branch) before running the setup. Also, if you plan to make changes
to the code and want to avoid reinstalling every time for them to became
effective, you can install the code in “developer mode” (as at point 1,
but using command `python setup.py develop` instead of `install`).
Please check developers notes for a list of active branches and their
features and for more details.

## How to use

You can test a succesful installation with:

``` python
from pysXsurf.data2D import data2D
```
