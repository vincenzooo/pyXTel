  description: "pyXsurf\n================\n\n<!-- WARNING: THIS FILE WAS AUTOGENERATED!\
    \ DO NOT EDIT! -->\n\n## Changes\n\n2022/09/06 Experimentally moved to nbdev 2021/07/21\
    \ Upgraded\ninstallation mechanism. 2020/11/09 Changed repository name from `pyXTel`\n\
    to `pyXSurf`.\n\n## Installation\n\nDownload or clone the project. You can use\
    \ git clone command by:\n\n``` sh\ngit clone https://github.com/vincenzooo/pyXSurf.git\n\
    ```\n\nor the `download` button at top of page.\n\nAt this point you have two\
    \ options:\n\n1.  Python installer (suggested): move to the folder with the code\
    \ and\n    call\n\n``` sh\npython setup.py install\n```\n\n.\n\n2.  Developer:\n\
    \n``` sh\npip install -e '.[dev]'\n```\n\nDevelopers branches can be installed\
    \ in the same way and they should\nwork equally (just have more unfinished stuff),\
    \ so the only thing you\nneed to do differently, is to switch branch,\ne.g.\_\
    `git checkout documentation` (where `documentation` is the name of\nthe branch)\
    \ before running the setup. Also, if you plan to make changes\nto the code and\
    \ want to avoid reinstalling every time for them to became\neffective, you can\
    \ install the code in \u201Cdeveloper mode\u201D (as at point 1,\nbut using command\
    \ `python setup.py develop` instead of `install`).\nPlease check developers notes\
    \ for a list of active branches and their\nfeatures and for more details.\n\n\
    ## How to use\n\nYou can test a succesful installation with:\n\n``` python\nfrom\
    \ pysXsurf.data2D import data2D\n```\n"
