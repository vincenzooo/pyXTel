pyXsurf
-------

Python library for X-Ray Optics, Metrology Data Analysis and Telescopes Design.

This library starts from code collected during many years of work on surface metrology and X-ray optics and
wants to offer to the community an extensible tool to perfom common operations on surface and profile data,
together with a set of tools to perform typical operations on data, in particular related to X-ray optics.

Installation
============

.. code:: bash

    pip install pyXsurf


Uninstalling
============

Project can be uninstalled running ``pip uninstall pyXsurf`` or equivalent.

How to use
==========

All modules are packaged into `pyXsurf` package, you can import them with something like::

.. code:: python

    from pyXsurf.pySurf.data2D import data2D


Additional resources for usage guidance
=======================================

- **docs** `official documentation <https://pyxsurf.readthedocs.io>`
- **tests** contains a collection of tests and examples.
- **notebooks** contains a collection of Jupyter notebooks with examples and tutorials.

Modules
=======

A basic description of the different modules is:

- **dataIO** Generic routines for accessing and manipulating data and files.
- **plotting** Plotting functions for pySurf data.
- **pyGeo3D** Functions for geometry in space (lines and planes).
- **pyProfile** Equivalent of pySurf acting on Profiles.
- **pySurf** Functions and classes acting on 3D points or surfaces.
- **thermal** Functions for modelling of thermal forming of glass.
