include test - call rst
========================
This is source/deleteme_link.rst. The header is listed in the TOC of the linking file, and here.

Next I try to include a reference to a file rst in a folder up in the hierarchy ../deleteme2/basic_usage2.rst

.. include:: ../deleteme2/basic_usage2.rst
