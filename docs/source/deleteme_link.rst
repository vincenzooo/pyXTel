include test - call rst
***********************
This is source/deleteme_link.rst. The header is listed in the TOC of the linking file, and here.

Next I try to include a reference to a file rst in a folder up in the hierarchy ../deleteme2/basic_usage2.rst

Any header appearing below is in the included file, note all sections in this page visualized also in tocs that list this rst.

.. include:: ../deleteme2/basic_usage2.rst
